# cloudscribe.Web.Navigation

cloudscribe.Web.Navigation ([NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/cloudscribe.Web.Navigation)) provides an easy to use solution for menus, breadcrumbs, and other navigation in ASP.NET Core web applications. It was implemented for use with other cloudscribe components, but it does not depend on other cloudscribe components, and you can use it in your projects even if you are not using other cloudscribe components.

For installation instruction and full details, see the documentation: https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/cloudscribe-web-navigation

The NavigationDemo.Web project has examples such as nodes filtered by roles, and a way to adjust breadcrumbs from a controller action. The demo app also has menu localization in 7 languages with a language switcher to illustrate how you can localize your own menus.

We use cloudscribe.Web.Navigation for the menus in [cloudscribe Core](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe), and in [cloudscribe SimpleContent](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe.SimpleContent)
